# Dim Souls

Imagine a game where the combat is forgiving and the boss fights are fun. Now set your standards way lower. Dim Souls, a completely unique game unlike anything else ever, sets our hero the "Picked-Posessed" against the toughest bad guys imaginable: Smashy and Stabby.

This top-down 2D action-game has the player control the Picked-Posessed, with the goal of defeating both Smashy and Stabby. In classic Dim Souls fashion, it wouldn't be a painful experience if you didn't have to fight both of them at the same time. While Smashy is slow, his giant hammer can destroy anything it touches. Stabby on the other hand is fast as lightning and will make it clear just how horrible the hitboxes are in this game. The player must use the layout of the room as well as the weaknesses of both boss's to their advantage in order to make it out alive!
